# NamazBaqi
Time remaining in next Namaz

a simple app logic that provides the time remaining in next namaz (a muslim prayer)

The purpose was to give a calculated time for the 'the big three' tasks, (To be productive in making a to-do list it is suggested by pros to divide all tasks into three main/important/urgent task called the big three.)

The Issue i faced was have a machanism of allocating each task some time, hence NamazBaqi concept.

Total 24 hours are divided into 6 parts, that is 6 namaz, and time interval of each namaz is then given to a particular task from the big three.
